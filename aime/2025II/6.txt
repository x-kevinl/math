Circle $\omega_1$ with radius $6$ centered at point $A$ is internally tangent at point $B$ to circle $\omega_2$ with radius $15$. Points $C$ and $D$ lie on $\omega_2$ such that $\overline{BC}$ is a diameter of $\omega_2$ and ${\overline{BC} \perp \overline{AD}}$. The rectangle $EFGH$ is inscribed in $\omega_1$ such that $\overline{EF} \perp \overline{BC}$, $C$ is closer to $\overline{GH}$ than to $\overline{EF}$, and $D$ is closer to $\overline{FG}$ than to $\overline{EH}$, as shown. Triangles $\triangle {DGF}$ and $\triangle {CHG}$ have equal areas. The area of rectangle $EFGH$ is $\frac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.

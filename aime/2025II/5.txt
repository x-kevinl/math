Suppose $\triangle ABC$ has angles $\angle BAC = 84^\circ, \angle ABC=60^\circ,$ and $\angle ACB = 36^\circ.$ Let $D, E,$ and $F$ be the midpoints of sides $\overline{BC}, \overline{AC},$ and $\overline{AB},$ respectively. The circumcircle of $\triangle DEF$ intersects $\overline{BD}, \overline{AE},$ and $\overline{AF}$ at points $G, H,$ and $J,$ respectively. The points $G, D, E, H, J,$ and $F$ divide the circumcircle of $\triangle DEF$ into six minor arcs, as shown. Find $\overarc{DE}+2\cdot \overarc{HJ} + 3\cdot \overarc{FG},$ where the arcs are measured in degrees.

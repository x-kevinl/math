Let $O(0,0),A(\tfrac{1}{2},0),$ and $B(0,\tfrac{\sqrt{3}}{2})$ be points in the coordinate plane. Let $\mathcal{F}$ be the family of segments $\overline{PQ}$ of unit length lying in the first quadrant with $P$ on the $x$-axis and $Q$ on the $y$-axis. There is a unique point $C$ on $\overline{AB},$ distinct from $A$ and $B,$ that does not belong to any segment from $\mathcal{F}$ other than $\overline{AB}$. Then $OC^2=\tfrac{p}{q}$, where $p$ and $q$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $p+q$.

Let $b \geq 2$ be an integer. Call a positive integer $n$ $b\textit{-eautiful}$ if it has exactly two digits when expressed in base $b$, and these two digits sum to $\sqrt{n}$. For example, $81$ is $13$-eautiful because $81=\underline{6}$$\underline{3}_{13}$ and $6+3=\sqrt{81}$. Find the least integer $b\geq 2$ for which there are more than ten $b$-eautiful integers.

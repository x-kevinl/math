Circles $\omega_1$ and $\omega_2$ intersect at two points $P$ and $Q,$ and their common tangent line closer to $P$ intersects $\omega_1$ and $\omega_2$ at points $A$ and $B,$ respectively. The line parallel to $AB$ that passes through $P$ intersects $\omega_1$ and $\omega_2$ for the second time at points $X$ and $Y,$ respectively. Suppose $PX=10,$ $PY=14,$ and $PQ=5.$ Then the area of trapezoid $XABY$ is $m\sqrt{n},$ where $m$ and $n$ are positive integers and $n$ is not divisible by the square of any prime. Find $m+n.$

A cube-shaped container has vertices $A,$ $B,$ $C,$ and $D,$ where $\overline{AB}$ and $\overline{CD}$ are parallel edges of the cube, and $\overline{AC}$ and $\overline{BD}$ are diagonals of faces of the cube, as shown. Vertex $A$ of the cube is set on a horizontal plane $\mathcal{P}$ so that the plane of the rectangle $ABDC$ is perpendicular to $\mathcal{P},$ vertex $B$ is $2$ meters above $\mathcal{P},$ vertex $C$ is $8$ meters above $\mathcal{P},$ and vertex $D$ is $10$ meters above $\mathcal{P}.$ The cube contains water whose surface is parallel to $\mathcal{P}$ at a height of $7$ meters above $\mathcal{P}.$ The volume of water is $\frac{m}{n}$ cubic meters, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n.$

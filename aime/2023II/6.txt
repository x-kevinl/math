Consider the L-shaped region formed by three unit squares joined at their sides, as shown below. Two points $A$ and $B$ are chosen independently and uniformly at random from inside the region. The probability that the midpoint of $\overline{AB}$ also lies inside this L-shaped region can be expressed as $\frac{m}{n},$ where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n.$

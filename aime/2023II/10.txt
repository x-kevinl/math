Let $N$ be the number of ways to place the integers $1$ through $12$ in the $12$ cells of a $2 \times 6$ grid so that for any two cells sharing a side, the difference between the numbers in those cells is not divisible by $3.$ One way to do this is shown below. Find the number of positive integer divisors of $N.$
$$\begin{array}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|} \hline
\,1\, & \,3\, & \,5\, & \,7\, & \,9\, & 11 \\ \hline
\,2\, & \,4\, & \,6\, & \,8\, & 10 & 12 \\ \hline
\end{array}$$

Let $k$ be a real number such that the system
\begin{align*}
&|25 + 20i - z| = 5 \\
&|z - 4 - k| = |z - 3i - k|
\end{align*}
has exactly one complex solution $z$. The sum of all possible values of $k$ can be written as $\frac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m + n$. Here $i = \sqrt{-1}$.

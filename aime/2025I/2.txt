On $\triangle ABC$ points $A$, $D$, $E$, and $B$ lie in that order on side $\overline{AB}$ 
with $AD = 4$, $DE = 16$, and $EB = 8$. Points $A$, $F$, $G$, and $C$ lie in that order on side $\overline{AC}$ with $AF = 13$, $FG = 52$, and $GC = 26$. Let $M$ be the reflection of $D$ through $F$, and let $N$ be the reflection of $G$ through $E$. Quadrilateral $DEGF$ has area $288$. Find the area of heptagon $AFNBCEM$.

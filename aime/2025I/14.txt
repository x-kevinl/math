Let $ABCDE$ be a convex pentagon with $AB=14,$ $BC=7,$ $CD=24,$ $DE=13,$ $EA=26,$ and $\angle B=\angle E=60^{\circ}.$ For each point $X$ in the plane, define $f(X)=AX+BX+CX+DX+EX.$ The least possible value of $f(X)$ can be expressed as $m+n\sqrt{p},$ where $m$ and $n$ are positive integers and $p$ is not divisible by the square of any prime. Find $m+n+p.$

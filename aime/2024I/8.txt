Eight circles of radius $34$ can be placed tangent to $\overline{BC}$ of $\triangle ABC$ so that the circles are sequentially tangent to each other, with the first circle being tangent to $\overline{AB}$ and the last circle being tangent to $\overline{AC}$, as shown. Similarly, $2024$ circles of radius $1$ can be placed tangent to $\overline{BC}$ in the same manner. The inradius of $\triangle ABC$ can be expressed as $\frac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.

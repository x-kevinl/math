Alice and Bob play the following game. A stack of $n$ tokens lies before them. The players take turns with Alice going first. On each turn, the player removes $1$ token or $4$ tokens from the stack. The player who removes the last token wins. Find the number of positive integers $n$ less than or equal to $2024$ such that there is a strategy that guarantees that Bob wins, regardless of Aliceâ€™s moves.

Find the largest prime number $p<1000$ for which there exists a complex number $z$ satisfying

• the real and imaginary part of $z$ are both integers;

• $|z|=\sqrt{p},$ and

• there exists a triangle whose three side lengths are $p,$ the real part of $z^{3},$ and the imaginary part of $z^{3}.$
